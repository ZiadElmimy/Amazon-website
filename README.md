# Amazon Website project (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
It's a project to apply the concepts I learn from the JavaScript course, from generating the HTML code using JavaScript to avoid duplication of the code written manually, and control the elements' classes to change the properties of the elements built.

In addition to make the pages of the website resposive and produce original 'Amazon' functionalities with some small changes.
